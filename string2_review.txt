D. verbing
-pretty much the same
-my code had return after each part of if statement
-solution set result variable and returned result only at end

E. not_bad
-ONE MAJOR OVERSIGHT IN MY CODE that solution had
==> i forgot to check for the case of not finding 'not' or 'bad'
==> to address this, solution made sure both indexes were != -1

F. front_back
-solution was slightly more efficient by starting with lengths already divided by 2 to find the approx middle
-because of this, it only needed to check for if length % 2 == 1, and then add 1 to the approx middle
