D. condense adjacent
-i think i did something slightly more efficient than the solution in one part and the solution was more efficient than my code in another way
-i think it was better to check len(nums)>0 at first because it is only checked once in the case of my code
-however, one thing the solution did better than i did was track the previous number
==> the solution used result[-1] to get the last number in the new list, while i stored the value in a new variable, previous

E. linear merge
-upon first glance my code is very different from the solution
-however, this is because the solution only handles adding one new element at a time
-instead, my solution handles two new elements at the same time (which admittedly makes the code more complicated)
-BUT, i believe this makes my code more efficient than the solution because i go through both lists simultaneously and loop only as many times as the shorter list, AT MOST
-COMPARATIVELY, the solution effectively goes through the loop as many times as the length of the shorter list, AT BEST, and twice as many times, AT WORST
