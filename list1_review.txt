A. match_ends
-exact same code as solution

B. front_x
-slight oversight in my code
==> my code checks for word[0], but this runs into trouble if word = ''
==> to combat this, the solution used word.startswith('x')

C. sort_last
-pretty much the same code as the solution
-solution used sorted(list), while i used list.sort(), return list
